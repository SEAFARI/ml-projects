# Rock or Mine Prediction 🪨⛏️  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify sonar signals as either **Rock** or **Mine** based on frequency-based sonar readings. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between the two categories.  

## 🔍 Dataset  
- The dataset contains sonar signal readings from undersea objects.  
- Features represent energy levels at different frequencies.  
- Labels:  
  - **Rock (R)**
  - **Mine (M)**  

## 🚀 Model Details  
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression  
- **Training Accuracy:** 83.42%  
- **Testing Accuracy:** 76.19%  

## 📊 Results  
- The model achieves a **training accuracy of 83.42%** and a **testing accuracy of 76.19%**.  
- Performance can be improved through feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, or trying different models.  

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
- Optimize model performance using feature engineering.  
- Compare results with other algorithms like SVM or Neural Networks.  
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
