Rock or Mine Prediction 🪨⛏️
📌 Project Overview
This project builds a Logistic Regression model to classify objects as either Rock or Mine based on sonar signal data. The dataset contains frequency-based sonar readings, and the goal is to predict whether the signal represents a rock or a mine.

🔍 Dataset
The dataset consists of sonar signal readings taken from undersea objects.
Features represent energy levels at different frequencies.
Labels:
Rock (R)
Mine (M)
🚀 Model Used
Logistic Regression
Trained on sonar signal data
Performance metrics:
Training Accuracy: 83.42%
Testing Accuracy: 76.19%
📊 Results
The model successfully classifies sonar signals with a reasonable accuracy.
Further improvements can be made using feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, or more advanced models like SVM or Neural Networks.
